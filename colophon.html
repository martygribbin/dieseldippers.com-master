    <h2 align="center">LIFT PITCH </h2>
    
    <p>Dieseldippers.com is a website dedicated to highlighting traffic congestion caused by customs checkpoints. It provides a graphical representation of the exact whereabouts of tailbacks in real time to allow road users to locate traffic jams and plan their route around them. The information is fresh every day and users can submit their own data to the map.</p>
    
  
    
    
    <h2 align="center">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>There will always be people in life who think they are 'players', forever trying to beat the system with unrelenting scams and a swagger of invincibility, and there are people like me who find things like this humorous. </p>
    
    <p>Some people use illegal fuel in their automobiles, its a fact. To counteract this custom officials set up checkpoints daily around the roads of Ireland to stop cars and test their fuel among other things, and the traffic congestion that builds up as a consequence is nothing short of astounding. </p>
    
<p>On one unfortunate winter day I was caught in one of these 'freaks of nature', waiting to get to the top of the queue so I could go on about my business. One hour of my life was wasted sitting in a traffic jam that I could have avoided. More importantly, however I missed a job interview. In that moment the idea came to me to develop something that could allow people to avoid this disruption to their daily routine and DieselDippers was born. </p>

  <p>DieselDippers.com is a website that allows people to highlight the whereabouts of customs officials checking cars for fuel so that they can avoid the tailbacks that they invariably bring. When a user enters an address or post code the data is parsed, geocoded and then plotted on the map that fills the homepage. Therefore law abiding citizens like myself can look at the website, see where the tailbacks are and avoid the hassle of sitting in traffic for hours on end. </p>
  
  <p>The database behind the website is truncated each night to ensure that the information appearing on the website is fresh and current every day. </p>

<p>It must be noted that the format of my project is not to encourage people to use illegal fuel, but to simply demonstrate what I can do in the context of design for the web. 
</p>

<p>I could have produced something boring and effective that gets me the marks I need to graduate but I would not have enjoyed creating it. </p>

<p>I wanted to design something that would stay in peoples minds when they hear about it, make them talk about it and hopefully make them use it. I find that this is a greater challenge as opposed to presenting a major project that will pale into insignificance when newer and more advanced technologies come along in the future.  </p>

<p>My idea could be adapted to suit many tasks but I found it amusing to produce something slightly controversial which will certainly catch the attention and be utilized by of some users of the www. </p>
